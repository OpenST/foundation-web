            The OpenST Foundation is a non-profit Hong Kong membership company. The Foundationâ€™s mandate is to support the OpenST protocol and to further the OpenST developer ecosystem.

          <p class="primary">
            The OpenST protocol is a layer II protocol for scaling Ethereum. OpenST enables Branded Tokens to be minted and transferred on Ethereum-based utility blockchains, backed by staking the OST token on public Ethereum. This innovation enables mainstream businesses to run high volume transactions on open scalable blockchains without congesting public Ethereum. The OST token is also used to pay for transaction fees on the utility chains.
          </p>
          <p class="primary">
            OpenST 0.9.0 was released on Ethereum Testnet in November 2017 and brought to Ethereum Mainnet with OpenST 0.9.1 in December 2017. Any developer can build applications on OpenST and enhance the protocol.
