            OpenST 0.9.0 was released on Ethereum Testnet in November 2017 and brought to Ethereum Mainnet with OpenST 0.9.1 in December 2017. Any developer can build applications on OpenST and enhance the protocol.
          </p>
          <p class="primary">
            OpenST was further enhanced by the community with the release of OpenST 0.9.2 in March 2018 to support Airdrops, Token Transfers, Pricing Engines, Token Rules engines, and RESTful APIs.
          </p>
        <p class="primary">
          OpenST 0.9.2 was implemented on Ethereum Mainnet and used by several partner companies to stake OST and mint Branded Tokens in September 2018.
        </p>
        <p class="primary">
          Openst Mosaic was first presented at ETH Berlin on 7 September, 2018. Mosaic introduces BFT consensus rules that allow validators to leverage auxiliary systems running in parallel for block production, while millions of transactions can be finalized before the header is asynchronously committed to Ethereum.
        </p>
        <p class="primary">
          Ethereum remains the sole source of truth by locking value tokens on Ethereum while minting a utility token representation on the auxiliary systems. Validators are rewarded collaboratively based on gas consumed, thereby solving for the verifier’s dilemma. As a result, Mosaic can finalize thousands of transactions per second on Ethereum at a lower gas price. The OpenST Mosaic white paper will be released in September 2018.
